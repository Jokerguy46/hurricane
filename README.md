# Hurricane Effect in Game

This project is a script for creating a hurricane effect in a game. It gradually increases the wind speed to maximum over a period of 5 minutes, randomizes the wind direction, and starts a particle effect at the player's location. It also turns off the power to create a blackout effect.

## How to Use

1. Include the script in your game.
2. Call the `startHurricane` function to start the hurricane effect.

## Debugging

If the hurricane effect is not starting correctly, you can check the console for a message that says "Particle effect started with ID: ". If the ID is not `nil` or `0`, it means the particle effect has been started correctly.

## Testing

This project is still in the testing phase. Please report any issues you encounter.
